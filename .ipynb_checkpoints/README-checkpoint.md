This economic data analysis project was created while following the youtube tutorial created by Rob Mulla:

In this project:
- The Fred api was used to search and pull down data regarding the unemployment and participation rates in US states.
- The data was cleaned, combined(concatenated) and modified.
- The data was plotted seperately in the form of interactive line graphs.
- The unemployment and participation rate data was plotted as a comparative line graph for every state.

Since the api is used, which used a private key, I would recommend the viewer to obtain their own api key from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html in order to swiftly run the code. The process would require the viewer to give minimal information and does not require any processing time. 
However, I have alse created csv files which can alse be used to achieve the same results. For this, the viewer would have to un-comment the lines of code which are supposed to read the csv files into the notebook.

Lastly, there are two notebooks:
- Analysis.ipynb: This is the main jupyter notebook for this project and is the more polished one of the two.
- Analysis_rough.ipynb: This is the notebook I used to follow along with the tutorial and is kept in accordance with the flow of the tutorial.
